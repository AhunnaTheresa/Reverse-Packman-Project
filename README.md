This is a reversed Pac-Man game, where players control the ghosts instead of Pac-Man. 
The objective is to catch Pac-Man before he collects all the pellets and clears the maze. 
The game mechanics are flipped, with players strategizing as the ghosts to corner and capture Pac-Man while avoiding being eaten. 
Each ghost may possess unique abilities or behavior patterns to add depth to the gameplay. 
The maze layout and power-ups could also be modified to create a fresh challenge. 
Overall, this reversed Pac-Man offers a fun twist on the classic game, providing an exciting experience for players to enjoy.
